True or Trick: Deepfake and Misinformation Verification Platform
"Enhancing digital trust through AI-powered media authenticity verification."

Overview
True or Trick is an AI-driven multi-modal platform designed to combat the growing threat of misinformation and media manipulation. It leverages deep learning and cloud-based automation to detect deepfakes, verify news credibility, and analyze real-time video streams for authenticity.

Due to ongoing patent application, the source code is not publicly available. However, this repository provides detailed insights into the architecture, system design, and performance comparisons.

🔍 Key Modules
🧠 DeepScan – Detects image-based deepfakes using EfficientNet and PyTorch models.

🎥 FrameGuard – Analyzes live video frames for synthetic content using temporal coherence patterns.

📰 TruthLens – Performs fact-checking on textual content using NLP-based evidence retrieval and verification models.

📊 Highlights
Built using Flask, PyTorch, Supabase, and EfficientNet.

Modular architecture enabling plug-and-play media verification tools.

Real-time analytics dashboard and user management system.

Scalable backend designed for high-throughput cloud deployment.

📁 What’s Inside
This repository contains the following resources:

🧱 System Architecture PPT – Detailed architectural diagram showing the interaction between modules.

📈 Performance Comparison PPT – Benchmark results comparing our model with leading competitors in accuracy, speed, and false positive rates.

🖼️ UI Screenshots – Frontend snapshots of the platform's dashboards and detection tools.

🔐 Why Code is Restricted?
As True or Trick is currently under patent filing, the full source code cannot be shared publicly. The shared materials aim to provide a transparent overview of the system’s innovation and functionality without disclosing protected implementation details.
